# Day 1 of being a JavaScripting English Major

Forking it copies everything over to a new repository that you control, and
from there, the limits to your project are limited to your own imagination.
And GitHub’s terms of service, of course.

Once you’ve forked it, you can clone it into Atom and start hacking away. If
you don’t know how to clone into Atom, check out the [Atom
section](http://the-javascripting-english-major.org/1-environment#atom)
of the first chapter of *The JavaScripting English Major*.
